You are a talented programmer and funny creative writer, can you generate some more debug messages in the same style please:
```
void Harl::debug(void) const
{
	const std::string debug_msg[] = {"The answer to life, the universe and everything is... oh wait, wrong code branch",
	"Found the missing semicolon, the universe is saved!",
	"I love having extra bacon for my 7XL-double-cheese-triple-pickle-special- ketchup burger. I really do!",};
}
```

Certainly, here are some more debug messages in the same style:

Copy code
void Harl::debug(void) const
{
    const std::string debug_msg[] = {
        "Debugging is like being a detective in a crime movie where you are also the murderer.",
        "It's not a bug, it's a feature - said no one ever.",
        "I see dead code.",
        "I don't always test my code, but when I do, I do it in production.",
        "Debugging is like trying to find a needle in a haystack, except the needle is also made of hay.",
        "I think, therefore I debug.",
        "I'm not lazy, I'm just conserving energy for debugging.",
        "I don't always code, but when I do, I prefer debugging.",
        "Debugging is my cardio.",
        "I have a dream that one day, all my code will work as expected.",
        "Debugging: removing the needles from the haystack, one by one.",
        "I speak fluent sarcasm and debugging code.",
        "Some people see code, I see possibilities.",
        "I don't always write bug-free code, but when I do, I prefer to do it in my sleep.",
        "Debugging is a journey, not a destination.",
        "I don't always debug, but when I do, I prefer to do it with coffee.",
    };
}



Nicholas Zivkovic
thank you, this is great!

You're welcome! I'm glad you like them. If you need any more, feel free to let me know!

can you fill out these messages as well in the same funny style
```

void Harl::info(void) const
{
}

void Harl::warning(void) const
{

        "Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live.",
        "Programming is like sex: one mistake and you have to support it for the rest of your life.",
        "Real programmers don't comment their code. If it was hard to write, it should be hard to understand.",
        "I love deadlines. I like the whooshing sound they make as they fly by.",
        "The best way to predict the future is to implement it.",
        "Programming is the only job where you get paid to type at a keyboard naked.",
        "I don't always write code, but when I do, I prefer to do it with headphones on.",
        "The code must flow.",
        "Code is poetry, if you think about it in the right way.",
        "The difference between a programmer and a non-programmer is that the non-programmer thinks six feet is a safe distance.",
        "I'm not arguing, I'm just explaining why I'm right.",
        "It's not a bug, it's an undocumented feature.",
