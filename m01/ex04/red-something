can you write me a very short funny story about red somethings

Sure, here's a short funny story about red somethings:
Once upon a time, there was a red apple, a red tomato, and a red pepper. They were all sitting on a kitchen counter, talking about their day.
The red apple said, "I got picked from a tree today, it was so exhilarating!"
The red tomato replied, "That's nothing, I got diced up and put in a delicious pasta sauce!"
The red pepper chuckled and said, "You both had it easy. I got stuffed with meat and rice, and then roasted in the oven!"
Just then, a big red hand swooped down and grabbed all three of them. They looked at each other in horror and screamed, "Oh no, we're all going to end up in the same stomach!"
But then, they heard a familiar voice say, "Don't worry, I'm just making a colorful salad for dinner tonight."
And that's the story of the red somethings who thought they were going to be eaten, but ended up in a salad instead.
